#Full Screen Slider
This project is an implementation of a full screen slider using pure CSS. With a nav bar at the top, when a slide is clicked, the image and header then transition into the frame.

##CSS
The slides are treated as radio elements since only one is in view at a time. The CSS used includes checked pseudo elements, sibling operators, transitions and transforms, as well as z-index, to ensure that the nav stays on top and that the new slide covers the old slide.
