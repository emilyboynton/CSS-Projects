#Wrap Text
This is a experiment in wrapping text around circle images.

##CSS
The CSS utilizes the shape-outside property to act as a buffer for the inline text to wrap around. Text will wrap around one or both of the images.

The images are floated either to the left or right.

#Images
Images were carefully selected out of the internet's best offerings, and are just about the best photos you can get of a [duck](http://cdn3.littlethings.com/app/uploads/2014/09/rxDvM.jpg) and a [fox](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/b9/a2/23/b9a2234cd42743f16a8335c8a8f7d061.jpg)
