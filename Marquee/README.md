#Marquee Lights
This project uses CSS to give the effect of marquee lights "chasing" each other. It is based on a Treehouse workshop.

##CSS
The CSS used in this project includes absolute centering, box-shadows (and an inset), gradients, nth-child, and animations.

##Animations
Keyframes use 0% and 100% states. To give the effect of the lights "chasing" each other, animation delays were used for groups of nth-children.
